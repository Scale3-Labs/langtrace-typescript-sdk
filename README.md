# Project Title

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager.

### Installation

Clone the repository and install its dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourprojectname.git
cd yourprojectname
npm install
```

### Building

This command converts TS files in src to JS in the dist directory.

### Running
Execute the application with:

```sh
Copy code
npm start
```
This will run the compiled app from the dist directory.

### Development Workflow
To automatically recompile TypeScript files upon changes during development:

```sh
Copy code
npm run dev
```
Ensure you've set up scripts in package.json for development workflow, including using tools like nodemon and ts-node.

### Testing
Describe how to run the automated tests for this system (if available):
